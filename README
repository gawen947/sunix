This project has multiple conflicting goals and as such is now obsolete until further notice.

This project original goal was to povide a taste of the FreeBSD command line into Linux.
That is basic tools were ported from FreeBSD base system to replace the GNU coreutils equivalent.
Originally the ported tools were amended to work as a replacement of GNU coreutils under Debian.
This worked to some extent and dpkg and all shell scripts could happily use them for while.
However this proved (without surprise) impossible to maintains since many options and behaviors
are different from one system tool to another. Thus the Makefile was changed to install those
tools as possible alias for an user interactive shell.

A secondary goal was to provide optimized version of some basic UNIX tools. Some tools were
remade to avoid the C library and reduced to their simpliest. This is the case, for instance,
of true and false which can do their work with only a single syscall and therefore don't need
to be linked to any library. The GNU coreutils equivalents do argument parsing and even have
Native Language Support.

A third goal was to provide a handy set of missing small UNIX utilies. Some of them were later
separated in a project of their own.

Finally this project was initially just made for fun and many aspect of which were not given
proper careful thinking.

If it is to be remade, it would be separated into three distincts projects:

  * FreeBSD-flavor: Port of some FreeBSD tools from the latest FreeBSD release to the Linux world.
  * tiny-core: Optimized version of some basic UNIX tools.
  * more: Missing small UNIX utilies.
